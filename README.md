## **Coding Challenge: Subtitle Timeline with Dynamic Controls**

Welcome to the PHONT coding challenge! Weâ€™re excited to see how you approach this task and bring with your frontend skills subtitles to life. This challenge is a small, yet significant, glimpse into the kind of work we doâ€”combining creativity and functionality to enhance accessibility and user engagement. Letâ€™s get started ðŸ˜‰!

### **Context**

You are a developer working on a react-based web application for assigning subtitles to videos. This happens in a video editor that you and your team are working on. The webapp looks very similar to the design of common editing software.

### **Task**

Start with a new React project. Your job is to develop one of the key components of our application: theÂ **subtitle timeline**. The timeline will help users visualize and interact with subtitles based on their assigned timestamps. Use the provided design concept as a guide.

### **Feature requirements:**

1. **Subtitle Display** 
    
    Use the given JSON file containing subtitle information (start time, end time, and text). Your timeline should read and display this data, showing subtitles during their assigned time ranges. The subtitles should appear and disappear dynamically, based on theÂ **`start_time`**Â andÂ **`end_time`**Â values.
    .**Note**: you do not need to create a video component! Only the timeline and text are enough.
    
2. **Dynamic Animation**
    
    When the control button is pressed, apply a provided CSS/JS animation to the currently displayed subtitle text. Replicate the animation showcased in the provided GIF.
